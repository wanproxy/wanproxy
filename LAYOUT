Directory	Description
=============	=============================================================
common		Non-specific functionality that is of general interest, e.g.
		the logging system, test infrastructure and Buffer class.
common/thread	Threading infrastructure.
common/timer	Time sampling infrastructure.
common/uuid	UUID API.
config		General-purpose configuration system infrastructure and some
		essential types and classes.
crypto		Cryptographic API and implementations, including hashes, MACs
		and encryption algorithms.
event		The event system and infrastructure to support it, such as
		the various implementations of the poll interface.
http		HTTP protocol implementation and utility functions.
io		IO system, namely file descriptors interfaces.
io/net		Networking abstractions for the IO system, utility functions and

io/pipe		Pipe infrastructure; abstractions and useful types.
io/socket	Sockets interface to the IO system.
network		Low-level networking, e.g. packet capture.
network/uinet	User-space TCP/IP stack (see network/uinet/LAYOUT for futher
		layout info).
